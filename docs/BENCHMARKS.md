# Benchmarks

Retained complete baseline: **23 families**, measured 2026-10-16 at Release source
`cd8d0c51727841ad6520dc032077475ee1aa1ddc` against GNU awk 5.2.1. Times and allocations below share this source,
at the declared five-change milestone. The latest scoped comparison below uses newer sources.
Interpreter/DotNetCompatibility remain defaults;
Utf8Regex adoption is postponed.

The retained table predates the SSH observation fix below. Its recorded gates passed;
login interference has not been excluded. Treat these ratios as directional until the next
declared complete refresh.

## Representative processing

Times are medians for one complete invocation. Lokad.Awk/awk divides Lokad elapsed time by
GNU elapsed time: 1.00× is parity, higher is slower. Allocations are managed GC bytes/invocation
in MiB, not GNU allocations, retained memory or allowances. Rows run from worst ratio to best.

| Case | Input KiB | Lokad ms | GNU ms | Lokad.Awk/awk | Lokad allocated MiB |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |

| Array reads, half hits / half new keys | 63.15 | 4.004 | 1.669 | 2.40× | 2.09 |
| Concatenate record and number | 20.00 | 3.514 | 1.539 | 2.28× | 1.42 |
| printf strings and integers | 24.00 | 4.121 | 1.806 | 2.28× | 1.66 |
| Boolean ERE matching | 32.00 | 2.626 | 1.275 | 2.06× | 0.75 |

| Literal field separator | 48.00 | 2.132 | 1.394 | 1.53× | 1.26 |
| Filter $1 / occasionally print $3, 64 fields | 1291.42 | 2.805 | 2.135 | 1.31× | 3.55 |
| Byte-run ERE record separator (GNU) | 36.00 | 1.514 | 1.442 | 1.05× | 1.00 |
| Multicharacter record separator (GNU) | 52.00 | 1.401 | 1.480 | 0.95× | 0.61 |

Both implementations use the same [scripts/fixtures](../benchmarks/Lokad.Awk.Benchmarks/ReferenceWorkloads.cs).
Medium cases have 4,096 records, except all-fields wide (256×64 fields) and join (4,096/file).
Early wide filtering reads `$1` on every record and `$3` on one in eight. Array reads have equal
existing/new keys. GNU-marked cases are supported conveniences, not a conformance claim.
Use these ratios to choose investigations. Confirm apparent parity on larger inputs before
making a broader claim.

## Latest controlled change

Measured 2026-10-16, `43e3cca` (runtime `7043d09`) →
`fa1e85a35eff68e731a7d4773479fafcb4c97063`: three warmups/five iterations and two launches per source,
in both source orders. The clean reverse order is retained from the first confirmation;
only the observer-contaminated forward order was replaced. Values are medians of the two
launch medians through the public full-invocation path. The harness includes **25 families**;
the newer unary and two-argument loops remain absent from the retained GNU comparison above.

| Workload | Median ms, before → after (corrected forward; retained reverse) | Managed bytes/invocation |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| Numeric array sort | 6.675→6.393; 6.729→6.593 | 3,237,704 (unchanged) |
| Keyed aggregation control | 3.131→3.134; 3.142→3.092 | 1,423,411 (unchanged) |
| Column projection control | 2.496→2.439; 2.404→2.483 | 1,405,595 (unchanged) |

Array-sort comparison helpers borrow immutable entries, avoiding repeated struct copies.
Existing comparison/tie, formatting, resource-preflight and callback checks pass.

Numeric sorting takes **2.0–4.2% less elapsed time** across the source orders. All four launch
pairs improve; one is nearly flat (0.14%). Allocations are unchanged in all three workloads.
Aggregation takes 0.10% longer/1.60% less time. Projection takes 2.32% less time/3.31% longer.
No general-workload gain is claimed. All eight confirmation quiet gates pass, with stable
source/library/driver/GNU identities. Earlier pilot/forward windows overlapping fresh SSH
logins are excluded: login-banner work can itself fail the CPU gate. One refused admission
is retained. The clean reverse order was reused; only the contaminated order was replaced.
Raw evidence remains local.

Runtime `fa1e85a3` passes **72,758 tests/OS**, 77 exact reference checks and
82 native goldens. All 77 work/host/field/encoding snapshots and 31 finite-resource rows
match the parent. Existing tests cover sort projections/ties, comparison caps, callbacks,
cancellation, failed admission before destination replacement, ownership and refunds.
[Exact-source Windows/Linux build/test/pack CI](https://github.com/Lokad/Awk/actions/runs/38888643497) passes; downloaded
reports verify all 166 selected sort/resource executions per OS.

## Environment and reproduction

Ubuntu 24.04.4, four EPYC 9V45 vCPUs, 16 GiB/no swap; SDK 10.0.401/.NET 10.0.12,
BenchmarkDotNet 0.15.8, C locale (C.UTF-8 for Unicode), UTC. The complete baseline uses
five warmups/nine iterations/one launch, with all four quiet gates passing and stable
identities/clean source. CPU admission requires at most 3% median/5% maximum background
load. Single-launch baseline variation limits small differences.

Lokad includes parsing/compilation through `Awk.TryParse`/`Awk.ExecuteAsync` with an application
in-memory host. GNU includes process launch and pipe I/O; startup is not subtracted. Both
consume complete output and check stdout/stderr, exit, length and SHA-256. Fixture setup and
correctness preflight are outside timing. GNU file fixtures use native files; Lokad uses
host-mediated in-memory files. These are embedding-versus-CLI costs, not pure evaluator
timings; small cases can be dominated by startup. Ordinary CI requires no GNU.

Build once, verify, then measure the affected workload and up to two contrasting controls:

```text
dotnet build benchmarks/Lokad.Awk.Benchmarks/Lokad.Awk.Benchmarks.csproj -c Release -p:RestoreLockedMode=true
dotnet benchmarks/Lokad.Awk.Benchmarks/bin/Release/net10.0/Lokad.Awk.Benchmarks.dll --compare --awk PATH_TO_GAWK --mode verify
dotnet benchmarks/Lokad.Awk.Benchmarks/bin/Release/net10.0/Lokad.Awk.Benchmarks.dll --check-machine
dotnet benchmarks/Lokad.Awk.Benchmarks/bin/Release/net10.0/Lokad.Awk.Benchmarks.dll --filter '*WorkloadAllocationBenchmarks*medium*string-functions*' --warmupCount 3 --iterationCount 5 --launchCount 1 --exporters json
```

For remote runs, keep one SSH connection open through precheck, measurement and postcheck.
Fresh logins can regenerate the VM login banner and add CPU work. Keep new logins, transfers
and builds outside these windows; thresholds remain unchanged.

Full Linux workflow: [reference wrapper](../benchmarks/run-reference-linux.sh). The driver
commands also work on Windows with a suitable GNU executable. Preserve the full correctness suite;
confirm promising changes once in both source orders. Refresh all families at declared
milestones (normally five accepted changes), not after each optimization. Record revisions,
dates/settings and failed quiet gates; do not relabel retained measurements. Keep raw/history
and BenchmarkDotNet artifacts local. See [runtime limits](RUNTIME_LIMITS.md) and
[record semantics](RECORD_SEMANTICS.md) for the behavioral boundaries.
