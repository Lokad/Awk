# Benchmarks

Retained complete baseline: **23 families**, measured 2026-10-16 at Release source
`cd8d0c51727841ad6520dc032077475ee1aa1ddc` against GNU awk 5.2.1. Times and allocations below share this source,
at the declared five-change milestone. The latest scoped comparison below uses newer sources.
Interpreter/DotNetCompatibility remain defaults;
Utf8Regex adoption is postponed.

The retained table predates the SSH observation fix below. Its recorded gates passed;
login interference has not been excluded. Treat these ratios as directional until the next
declared complete refresh.

The scheduled 26-family refresh at `1468c21` did not qualify: a GNU early-wide-fields invocation
exceeded the driver's 15-second deadline. Allocations never started; partial timings are excluded.
The attempt is closed without an immediate rerun. The controlled result below remains qualified.

## Representative processing

Times are medians for one complete invocation. Lokad.Awk/awk divides Lokad elapsed time by
GNU elapsed time: 1.00× is parity, higher is slower. Allocations are managed GC bytes/invocation
in MiB, not GNU allocations, retained memory or allowances. Rows run from worst ratio to best.

| Case | Input KiB | Lokad ms | GNU ms | Lokad.Awk/awk | Lokad allocated MiB |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| ERE capture arrays (GNU) | 28.00 | 36.294 | 7.765 | 4.67× | 16.05 |

| Loop and numeric arithmetic | 8.00 | 7.049 | 2.927 | 2.41× | 1.32 |
| Array reads, half hits / half new keys | 63.15 | 4.004 | 1.669 | 2.40× | 2.09 |
| Concatenate record and number | 20.00 | 3.514 | 1.539 | 2.28× | 1.42 |
| printf strings and integers | 24.00 | 4.121 | 1.806 | 2.28× | 1.66 |
| Boolean ERE matching | 32.00 | 2.626 | 1.275 | 2.06× | 0.75 |
| Field loop, 3 fields | 60.00 | 4.503 | 2.202 | 2.05× | 1.40 |
| Field-key membership, equal hits/misses | 48.56 | 2.573 | 1.317 | 1.95× | 1.41 |
| ERE field separator | 48.00 | 3.747 | 1.994 | 1.88× | 3.49 |
| Project a column / output | 60.00 | 2.462 | 1.327 | 1.85× | 1.34 |
| Filter three fields | 24.00 | 2.815 | 1.535 | 1.83× | 1.30 |
| Field loop, 64 fields | 80.00 | 3.328 | 2.175 | 1.53× | 1.08 |
| Literal field separator | 48.00 | 2.132 | 1.394 | 1.53× | 1.26 |
| Filter $1 / occasionally print $3, 64 fields | 1291.42 | 2.805 | 2.135 | 1.31× | 3.55 |
| Byte-run ERE record separator (GNU) | 36.00 | 1.514 | 1.442 | 1.05× | 1.00 |
| Multicharacter record separator (GNU) | 52.00 | 1.401 | 1.480 | 0.95× | 0.61 |

Both implementations use the same [scripts/fixtures](../benchmarks/Lokad.Awk.Benchmarks/ReferenceWorkloads.cs).
Medium cases have 4,096 records, except all-fields wide (256×64 fields) and join (4,096/file).
Early wide filtering reads `$1` on every record and `$3` on one in eight. Array reads have equal
existing/new keys. GNU-marked cases are supported conveniences, not a conformance claim.
Use these ratios to choose investigations. Confirm apparent parity on larger inputs before
making a broader claim.

## Latest controlled change

Measured 2026-10-16, `34c5c6ed064805c47ca554e9f55e452cbb17d12b` →
`1468c21721dca0c3c90d5127d5c7aab49a784f6e`: three warmups/five iterations and two launches/source,
in both source orders. The baseline adds the same multi-column fixture to runtime `f8caf6e`;
the fixture and inputs are identical. Values are medians of the two launch medians through
the public full-invocation path, separate from the complete comparison above. The harness
now covers 26 families.

| Workload | Median ms, before → after (two source orders) | Managed bytes/invocation |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| Three-column projection | 4.544→4.078; 4.452→4.050 | 2,692,213 (unchanged) |
| printf control | 3.898→3.861; 3.858→3.849 | 1,739,296 (unchanged) |
| Single-column projection control | 2.467→2.488; 2.496→2.483 | 1,405,595 (unchanged) |

Stdout `print` with two through four values uses locals and formatted local segments, removing
two staging array transports and nested emission. Field values keep their existing ownership.
Formatting uses the existing lease and atomic append; argument/OFS/ORS/format order, UTF-8,
fuel, cancellation, statement flushing and actual host-user lifetime remain qualified.

Multi-column printing takes **9.0–10.2% less elapsed time**. All four launch pairs improve,
one by 1.3%; the first order has up to 10.7% spread between launch medians. Managed allocations
are unchanged because default execution already pools the arrays. printf takes 0.94%/0.24%
less time; single-column projection takes 0.86% more/0.52% less. No control or general gain is
claimed. All confirmation gates and source/library/driver/GNU identities pass. Journal evidence
excludes extra authenticated SSH logins in all six timing windows; none were repeated.

Runtime `1468c21` passes **72,823 tests/OS**, 80 exact reference snapshots, 86 equivalent native
goldens and 30 limited-stack scenarios/OS. One additional native case records an unchanged
[numeric OFS/ORS spelling difference](COMPATIBILITY_CONTRACT.md#values-numbers-and-formatting);
it is explicitly classified. Of 32 finite rows, 26 match exactly; six have only lower estimated
memory peaks (52–192 bytes). Actual mutation/formatting/output allocations still preflight;
reduced staging can relax optional memory thresholds. Disabling the new path fails seven
work/storage checks while nine controls pass; exact restoration/full correctness pass.
Pending operands, refused admission and noncooperative host completion are covered.
[Exact-source Windows/Linux build/test/pack CI](https://github.com/Lokad/Awk/actions/runs/38899613295) passes; downloaded reports
verify all 133 distinct selected print/resource guards/OS. Raw data and detailed histories stay local.

## Environment and reproduction

Ubuntu 24.04.4, four EPYC 9V45 vCPUs, 16 GiB/no swap; SDK 10.0.401/.NET 10.0.12,
BenchmarkDotNet 0.15.8, C locale (C.UTF-8 for Unicode), UTC. The complete baseline uses
five warmups/nine iterations/one launch, with all four quiet gates passing and stable
identities/clean source. CPU admission requires at most 3% median/5% maximum background
load. Single-launch baseline variation limits small differences.

Lokad includes parsing/compilation through `Awk.TryParse`/`Awk.ExecuteAsync` with an application
in-memory host. GNU includes process launch and pipe I/O; startup is not subtracted. Both
consume complete output and check stdout/stderr, exit, length and SHA-256. Fixture setup and
correctness preflight are outside timing. GNU file fixtures use native files; Lokad uses
host-mediated in-memory files. These are embedding-versus-CLI costs, not pure evaluator
timings; small cases can be dominated by startup. Ordinary CI requires no GNU.

Build once, verify, then measure the affected workload and up to two contrasting controls:

```text
dotnet build benchmarks/Lokad.Awk.Benchmarks/Lokad.Awk.Benchmarks.csproj -c Release -p:RestoreLockedMode=true
dotnet benchmarks/Lokad.Awk.Benchmarks/bin/Release/net10.0/Lokad.Awk.Benchmarks.dll --compare --awk PATH_TO_GAWK --mode verify
dotnet benchmarks/Lokad.Awk.Benchmarks/bin/Release/net10.0/Lokad.Awk.Benchmarks.dll --check-machine
dotnet benchmarks/Lokad.Awk.Benchmarks/bin/Release/net10.0/Lokad.Awk.Benchmarks.dll --filter '*WorkloadAllocationBenchmarks*medium*string-functions*' --warmupCount 3 --iterationCount 5 --launchCount 1 --exporters json
```

For remote runs, keep one SSH connection open through precheck, measurement and postcheck.
Fresh logins can regenerate the VM login banner and add CPU work. Keep new logins, transfers
and builds outside these windows; thresholds remain unchanged.

Full Linux workflow: [reference wrapper](../benchmarks/run-reference-linux.sh). The driver
commands also work on Windows with a suitable GNU executable. Preserve the full correctness suite;
confirm promising changes once in both source orders. Refresh all families at declared
milestones (normally five accepted changes), not after each optimization. Record revisions,
dates/settings and failed quiet gates; do not relabel retained measurements. Keep raw/history
and BenchmarkDotNet artifacts local. See [runtime limits](RUNTIME_LIMITS.md) and
[record semantics](RECORD_SEMANTICS.md) for the behavioral boundaries.
