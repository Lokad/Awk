# Benchmarks

Retained complete baseline: **23 families**, measured 2026-10-16 at Release source
`cd8d0c51727841ad6520dc032077475ee1aa1ddc` against GNU awk 5.2.1. Times and allocations below share this source,
at the declared five-change milestone. This complete comparison is retained; newer scoped
results and the refused refresh are separate. Interpreter/DotNetCompatibility remain defaults;
Utf8Regex adoption is postponed.

## Representative processing

Times are medians for one complete invocation. Lokad.Awk/awk divides Lokad elapsed time by
GNU elapsed time: 1.00× is parity, higher is slower. Allocations are managed GC bytes/invocation
in MiB, not GNU allocations, retained memory or allowances. Rows run from worst ratio to best.

| Case | Input KiB | Lokad ms | GNU ms | Lokad.Awk/awk | Lokad allocated MiB |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |

Both implementations use the same [scripts/fixtures](../benchmarks/Lokad.Awk.Benchmarks/ReferenceWorkloads.cs).
Medium cases have 4,096 records, except all-fields wide (256×64 fields) and join (4,096/file).
Early wide filtering reads `$1` on every record and `$3` on one in eight. Array reads have equal
existing/new keys. GNU-marked cases are supported conveniences, not a conformance claim.
This current baseline is not a controlled cumulative speedup; confirm apparent parity on
larger inputs before making a broader claim.

## Latest controlled change

Measured 2026-10-16, `2a423fd` → `45c3d92ab36b69cb7666de6ab13693f792ccc045`: three warmups/five
iterations and two launches per source, in both source orders. The baseline adds the shared
function-loop fixture to runtime `aa1fd2c`; the fixture and inputs are identical in both lanes.
Values are medians of the two launch medians. GNU timings and the complete table above
retain their stated source; the harness now includes 24 families.

| Workload | Median ms, before → after (two source orders) | Managed bytes/invocation |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| Loop with arithmetic function calls | 14.168→10.471; 14.542→10.554 | 1,399,125→1,399,933 |
| Plain arithmetic control | 6.789→6.728; 6.443→6.599 | 1,381,835→1,381,883 |
| Two-file join control | 7.868→7.983; 7.980→7.907 | 4,430,330→4,430,378 |

Eligible interpreter loops reuse bounded known-call metadata and existing function frames.
Original statements remain for VM, lint, pending-output, raised-syntax and stack-safety fallback;
logical fuel, caller/alias order, cancellation, mutation admission and governed refunds remain.

Function loops take **26.1–27.4% less elapsed time**, with every launch pair
improving by at least 22.0%. Preparation adds 808 managed bytes/invocation (under 0.06%).
Plain arithmetic is mixed: 0.9% less in one order, 2.4% more in the other; one pair takes 8.2%
longer. Join controls are 1.5% more/0.9% less. Both controls add 48 bytes. No control or general
gain is claimed. All eight confirmation quiet gates pass; source/library/driver/GNU identities
stay fixed. Raw results and histories remain local.

Runtime `45c3d92a` passes 72,668 tests/OS, 74 exact reference checks, 77 native goldens
and 26 stack scenarios. All 74 work/host/field/encoding snapshots and 31 finite rows match the
parent. Removing preparation fails four work/cancellation guards. Focused checks cover exact
fuel/partial state, caller/alias/depth behavior, pending users and actual path selection.
[Exact-source Windows/Linux build/test/pack CI](https://github.com/Lokad/Awk/actions/runs/38859270240) passes; downloaded reports verify
all 40 selected loop/call/fuel/alias/cancellation executions per OS.

The scheduled 24-family refresh collected all timings and allocations, but its final allocation
quietness sample reached 6.53% CPU against a 5% maximum. That attempt is retained locally and
is not a qualified complete baseline. The table above remains at `cd8d0c5`; no immediate retiming.

## Environment and reproduction

Ubuntu 24.04.4, four EPYC 9V45 vCPUs, 16 GiB/no swap; SDK 10.0.401/.NET 10.0.12,
BenchmarkDotNet 0.15.8, C locale (C.UTF-8 for Unicode), UTC. The complete baseline uses
five warmups/nine iterations/one launch, with all four quiet gates passing and stable
identities/clean source. CPU admission requires at most 3% median/5% maximum background
load. Single-launch baseline variation limits small differences.

Lokad includes parsing/compilation through `Awk.TryParse`/`Awk.ExecuteAsync` with an application
in-memory host. GNU includes process launch and pipe I/O; startup is not subtracted. Both
consume complete output and check stdout/stderr, exit, length and SHA-256. Fixture setup and
correctness preflight are outside timing. GNU file fixtures use native files; Lokad uses
host-mediated in-memory files. These are embedding-versus-CLI costs, not pure evaluator
timings; small cases can be dominated by startup. Ordinary CI requires no GNU.

Build once, verify, then measure the affected workload and up to two contrasting controls:

```text
dotnet build benchmarks/Lokad.Awk.Benchmarks/Lokad.Awk.Benchmarks.csproj -c Release -p:RestoreLockedMode=true
dotnet benchmarks/Lokad.Awk.Benchmarks/bin/Release/net10.0/Lokad.Awk.Benchmarks.dll --compare --awk PATH_TO_GAWK --mode verify
dotnet benchmarks/Lokad.Awk.Benchmarks/bin/Release/net10.0/Lokad.Awk.Benchmarks.dll --check-machine
dotnet benchmarks/Lokad.Awk.Benchmarks/bin/Release/net10.0/Lokad.Awk.Benchmarks.dll --filter '*WorkloadAllocationBenchmarks*medium*string-functions*' --warmupCount 3 --iterationCount 5 --launchCount 1 --exporters json
```

Full Linux workflow: [reference wrapper](../benchmarks/run-reference-linux.sh). The driver
commands also work on Windows with a suitable GNU executable. Preserve the full correctness suite;
confirm promising changes once in both source orders. Refresh all families at declared
milestones (normally five accepted changes), not after each optimization. Record revisions,
dates/settings and failed quiet gates; do not relabel retained measurements. Keep raw/history
and BenchmarkDotNet artifacts local. See [runtime limits](RUNTIME_LIMITS.md) and
[record semantics](RECORD_SEMANTICS.md) for the behavioral boundaries.
